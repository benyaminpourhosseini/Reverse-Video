-over and under exposure: If the photography sensor receives too little (too much) light, the photo becomes dark (bright)

*when an image is under(over) exposure ,histogram is shifted to left(right)

-brightness: brightness of a grayscale image is the average intensity of all pixels in image

-contrast:the contrast of a grayscale image indicates how easily objects in the image can be distinguished

*high(low) contrast image:many(few) unique intensity value

-high dynamic range  means very bright and very dark parts in a single image(many distinct values)

*solution:
.capture multiple images at different exposures
.combine them using image processing

-Note:ideal histogram is uniform
